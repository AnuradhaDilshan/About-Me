                My keen interest in technology has led me to explore the ever-evolving world of information technology,

                such as photography, videography, and graphic design. With an unwavering commitment to integrity and

                In the Web Design course, my primary goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of HTML, CSS, and
                responsive design principles. I aim to develop the skills needed to create visually appealing and
                user-friendly websites that work seamlessly across various devices. Additionally, I am excited to apply
                my creativity and technical skills to craft visually stunning and user-friendly websites that make a
                positive impact on users and clients alike. By the end of the course, I hope to have the confidence and
                proficiency to take on web design projects and contribute to creating impactful online experiences.<br>
